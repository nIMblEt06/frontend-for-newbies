# Frontend for Newbies
Hi!
Here is a guide which should be able to help you get started with Frontend from scratch.
This contains almost every source and learning practice that I have referred to in over an year of developing frontend of various projects.

- Get started with HTML,
- Style your code with CSS,
- ✨JavaScriptify it! ✨

## How do I know if I should do Frontend?
Let's look at the major development verticals you might try out to begin with.
- App 
- FrontEnd
- BackEnd

Now, let's look at what learning any of these verticals majorly make you capable of.
- If you become an App Developer, you'll be capable of making Applications that people may use on their Android/iOS devices, which essentially means being able to code the client-side experience of any application. Once you delve in deeper, you'll meet your Backend friends and use APIs(Application Programming Interfaces) which they create that you would be fetching and/or posting data from/to.
- If you choose the FrontEnd path(I did), you're doing almost the same things as your App Dev peers, but not really. As a frontend dev, you're responsible for the client-side experience of any website that you create. You code how your website looks and how it responds to certain events. Once you're capable enough for that, you meet your Backend friends as well.
- Yes, option 3, you want to be the backend friend these app dev and and frontend people are nothing without. My backend friends like to call themselves the real coders, and we give them that since all we do on frontend(or app), is display the end results of whatever data manipulations they are responsible for. Backend, I'd say is the most interesting part of dev-work since you deal with the brain of any application, and the APIs you create are the skeleton for the entire project's working.

I tried to be funny. Anyways, if the above descriptions helped you gain even a bit of bias for one of these verticals over the other one, I'd say go forth with your instinct and try it out until you're sure of whether you wish to stick with it or cross it off the list. 
If your choice was not Frontend, I'm afraid this is as helpful as I can be to you.
Here's App Dev resources from the best guy I personally know : [xCarnage]
I'm hoping my backend friends will be able to give me something to put here some day. :/

# FrontEnd 101

Alright.
HTML-CSS-JavaScript crowd, Let's build! ✨

### HTML
HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) basically provides you with the ability to create the backbone  for a website's layout. It's THE most essential and easiest thing to learn when getting started with Frontend. HTML is made up of tags and their attributes, which define their behaviour.
```
<img src="clocktower.png"/>
```
Here, the 'img' is the tag, which has the 'src' attribute, which specifies the source path of the image we're wishing to import to our HTML project.
Yes, it's that simple.
I would highly recommend NOT getting stuck on being the perfect HTML God figure by remembering all the tags and what they do before moving forward. 
Remember that you're not learning this for an exam, and you will always have the Internet(let's hope that stays) for whenever and wherever you get stuck in the process of development, and you will be going back to these reference websites more frequently than you'd imagine. 
To be very honest, the best resources you have online are free.
So, I would like to introduce you to freeCodeCamp. 
Here's a link to their [HTML] Tutorial.
This is a 4 Hour long video, but since this is not like your General Chemistry lectures and you actually wish to learn something from these, I would want you to code-along with the instructor.
You might(will) get stuck while replicating his steps, and in the process of debugging it, you'll learn a thing or two as well. That is where the essence of dev work truly lies.

### PitStop
If you feel like one long video is not your type and something fragmented would suit you better, a one-stop tested source for learning frontend would be [CodeWithHarry]. This HyperLink takes you to CodeWithHarry's Web Developer course. The Frontend part of that course is till the 61st video, which includes HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript which is more than enough to get you started with development. Once you get comfortable with the JavaScript taught there, he has another [JavaScript] course which teaches you advanced JS, which truly strengthens your Frontend foundations.

### CSS and JavaScript
Alright! We're done with HTML, or so we wish.
If I tell you to make websites now, you surely will, but they will look ugly.
It's time we changed that, right?

Cascading Style Sheets. CSS helps you style everything you put on an HTML document, (you can also style elements that don't exist {learn: pseudo-elements}) make them look pleasing to the eye, and most importantly gives a better structure to the backbone already laid out by HTML.
So, where do we learn CSS? Well, I am learning CSS till-date and I am very sure there still will be stuff to learn years down the line as well. 

To get started though, a [CSS] tutorial from freeCodeCamp should be enough. Please don't just binge watch this video in one-go and expect yourself to be magically good at this. That is just not how this works. 
Go to your code-editor, pause the video, replicate. Repeat. 
It's literally that simple. You already know what I'll tell you for JavaScript now, don't you.
Yes. you could go to YouTube, search freeCodeCamp JavaScript, hop on the first video and be good to go. But, what if there's a better way to do it?

Introduction: [Scrimba]. This link takes you to Scrimba, which is an interactive platform to learn the same things that you would from a YouTube video, but in a more fun manner. This is very helpful when learning languages likes JS which does get pretty complicated somewhere in the process and might make you wish to quit. Doing this course on Scrimba gives you enough hands-on experience with coding to understand how you can build logic to do simple tasks, and how you can apply the same logic when you're dealing with problems/situations while you're building your projects.
If you have doubts on specific topics while learning any of this for the first time, the CodeWithHarry playlist I mentioned in the PitStop section should be able to help you out with it.

## Bonus Section

So, what is this about? 
Why did I write over a thousand words if all I had to do was copy-paste 5 YouTube links and praise freeCodeCamp and CWH?
Well, here's something. What these playlists and videos allow you to do is just your introduction to the development world. As you get more involved in this, I would like you to slowly reduce relying on these video sources, and start reading up on documentations because that is information in its purest form, from one dev to another.

Whenever you get stuck in this whole process of learning, and can't understand how anything works, I would recommend reading up more about that topic on the following sources before referring to YouTube channels, as when you start building your projects from scratch, you would have to refer to these docs for case-specific issues and there might not be YouTube tutorials available for the same.
